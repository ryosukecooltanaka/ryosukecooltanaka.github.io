    <h2>Blogs</h2>
    <a href="http://adhoc123.blogspot.com/" class="mainlink">
      <h3 class="mainlink">Blog ad hoc (JP)</h3></a>
      <p class="bpexp">This blog mostly features essays on non-scientific issues.
        So far it has been updated few times a year.</p>
    <a href="http://ganingen.blogspot.com/" class="mainlink">
      <h3 class="mainlink">Mothpeople (JP)</h3></a>
      <p class="bpexp">This blog featuring pictures of moths I found on streets is intended to shed light on their seldom noticed beauty and diversity (, but ended up dominated by pics of butterflies).
        Updated every time I find something.
        Co-hosted by a friend of mine.</p>

        <h3 class="mainlink">Visual illusion</h3></a>
        <p class="bpexp">While I was at <a href="http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/YotsumotoLab/index_en.php">Yotsumoto lab</a> at the University of Tokyo,
          I programmed several novel visual illusions as a programming practice for psychophysics experiments.
          Some of the works were chosen for <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/sakkon/sakkon-e.html">the illusion contest</a> hosted by the Japanese psychonomic society.
          Unlike other prize-winning works, mine so far haven't gone viral, unfortunately.</p>

        <h3 class="mainlink">Electronics</h3></a>
        <p class="bpexp">I have recently taken up some simple electronics projects as a hobby, hoping to acquire some skills useful at the lab.
          I'm also planning to build some simple devices that mimic some interesting neural circuits found in flies.</p>
      <a href="***" class="mainlink">
        <h3 class="mainlink">Compositions</h3></a>
        <p class="bpexp">I used to play the saxophone and clarinet in bands and orchestras up until few years ago.
        I also have been writing some classical-styled music since when I was a high school junior, mostly for the piano or small ensembles.
        I might make a list of and upload sheet music of those pieces at some point.</p>
