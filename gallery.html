        The Orb Illusion. When you fixate on the central cross, the cyan dot
        (which is isoluminant with the background) appears to be not moving.
        I won the 3rd place at <a href='http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/sakkon/sakkon2016.html'>
        the annual Illusion Contest in Japan in 2016 </a>
        with this illusion.

        The Cyclone Illusion. The dots appear to be moving outwards, even though
        they are actually moving on a circle.

        The left hemisphere of my cerebral cortex, scanned with a 3T MRI scanner
        at the University of Tokyo, circa 2015. The pial surface was reconstructed and
        segmented into cortical areas with the FreeSurfer software.
        Likely it has shrunk a little bit over the years.

        Much of my PhD works circled arround neurons called T4/T5, which are the first
        neurons sensitive to directions of motion in the fly brain. The bright yellow
        blobs are the cell bodies of T4/T5 sitting on the outer surface of a neuropil
        called lobula plate, and the two curved planes are
        the deepest layer of medulla and the shallowest layer of lobula, where
        dendrites of T4 and T5 respectively innervates.

        This classic illusion called "Fraser-Wilcox illusion" first reported in 70's
        gives the impression of slow rotation, even though it is a stationary image.
      <a href='https://www.wired.com/story/what-virtual-reality-for-flies-teaches-us-about-human-vision/'>  Our paper in 2020 </a>showed that flies are also vulnerable to this exact same illusion
        just like us, revealing a surprising similarity between human and fly brains.

        The dendrites of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220305844"> LC11 neurons</a>,
        visualized with five different fluorescent indicators of neural activity
        and neurotrasmission. These different indicators can elucidate various aspects
        of signal transmissions in specific types of neurons, helping us understand
        how the brian perform computation.

        The fly brain neuron called PLP219 (in green), which we identified to be
        involved in visually-driven collision avoidance behaviors in <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982222005929'>this paper</a>.
        I created a new combinatorial transgenic driver (split Gal4) to label this neuron, with a help
        of a computational tool <a href='https://neuronbridge.janelia.org/'>NeuronBridge</a>.

        <a href='https://www.eneuro.org/content/9/2/ENEURO.0053-22.2022'>this paper</a>. You can brouse
